# Simple To Do App

This is a basic To-Do list application. You can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** A fast build tool for modern web projects.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **JavaScript:** The programming language used.
- **Local Storage:** Used to save your tasks in the browser.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Add new tasks with a title and details.
- **Edit Tasks:** Change the title or details of existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks you don't need anymore.
- **Complete Tasks:** Mark tasks as done. You can also unmark them.
- **View Completed Tasks:** See a separate list of tasks you finished.
- **Persistence:** Tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so they don't disappear when you close the page.

## How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-link>
    cd simpletodo
    ```

    _(Replace `<your-repository-link>` with the actual link to your code)_

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    You need Node.js and npm installed.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will usually open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Creates a production-ready build of the app.
- `npm run lint`: Checks the code for potential errors using ESLint.
- `npm run preview`: Starts a local server to preview the production build.
